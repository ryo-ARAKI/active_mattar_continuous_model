abstract = {Self-sustained turbulent structures have been observed in a wide range of living fluids, yet no quantitative theory exists to explain their properties. We report experiments on active turbulence in highly concentrated 3D suspensions of Bacillus subtilis and compare them with a minimal fourth-order vector-field theory for incompressible bacterial dynamics. Velocimetry of bacteria and surrounding fluid, determined by imaging cells and tracking colloidal tracers, yields consistent results for velocity statistics and correlations over two orders of magnitude in kinetic energy, revealing a decrease of fluid memory with increasing swimming activity and linear scaling between energy and enstrophy. The best-fit model parameters allow for quantitative agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {Dynamics. We simulate a system of N rigid rods of length , moving in a 2D volume A with periodic boundary conditions. Steric rod-rod interactions are represented by a segment model, i.e., each rod is partitioned into n equidistant segments. All segments from different rods interact with each other via a Yukawa potential [1]. The pair potential of two rods $\alpha$ and $\beta$, that have orientation unit vectors {\{}{\^{u}} $\alpha$ , ˆ u $\beta$ {\}} and are separated by the center-of-mass distance ∆r $\alpha$$\beta$ , is given by U $\alpha$$\beta$ = U0 n 2 n X i=1 n X j=1 exp(−r $\alpha$$\beta$ ij /$\lambda$) r $\alpha$$\beta$ ij. [ 1 ] Here, U0 is the potential amplitude, $\lambda$ the screening length, and r $\alpha$$\beta$ ij = |∆r $\alpha$$\beta$ + (l{\^{i}} u $\alpha$ − lj{\^{u}}ljˆlj{\^{u}} $\beta$)| [ 2 ] the distance between the ith segment of rod $\alpha$ and the jth segment of rod $\beta$, with li ∈ [−(− $\lambda$)/2, (− $\lambda$)/2] denoting the position of segment i along the symmetry axis of the rod $\alpha$. The screening length $\lambda$ defines the effective diameter of the segments. The 'shape' of a rod of length is then determined by the aspect ratio a = /$\lambda$. [ 3 ] The case a = 1 corresponds to a single Yukawa point particle (n = 1). For a {\textgreater} 1, the number of segments per rod is fixed as n = 3 for 1 3 with {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered} denoting the nearest integer. Considering the dynamical regime relevant to microorganisms , we assume that the motion of the SPRs is overdamped due to solvent friction (zero Reynolds number limit Re = 0). ∆r F ˆ u $\lambda$ r ij Fig. S1. Sketch of the SPR model. Each rod is represented by n = 5 repulsive Yukawa segments and has an aspect ratio a = /$\lambda$. Self-propulsion is provided by a constant force F acting along the main rod axis indicated by the orientational unit vector{\^{u}}vectorˆvector{\^{u}}. The total rod pair potential is obtained by a sum over all Yukawa segment pairs with distance r ij according to Eq. [1]. Since we are interested in the collision-dominated dynamics in dense bacterial suspensions, we neglect thermal and intrinsic [2] fluctuations of the bacterial orientation and restrict our study to deterministic motions. With these simplifying assumptions, the equations of motion for the center-of-mass r$\alpha$(t) and orientation{\^{u}}$\alpha$orientationˆorientation{\^{u}}$\alpha$(t) of an SPR are of first order in time and can be written in the compact form f T {\textperiodcentered} d dt r$\alpha$ = F ˆ u$\alpha$ − −r $\alpha$ U, [ 4 ]},

abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, occurring from astrophysical to biophysical scales. At the same time, it is widely recognized as one of the key unsolved problems in modern physics, representing a paradigmatic example of nonlinear dynamics far from thermodynamic equilibrium.Whereas in the past, most theoretical work in this area has been devoted to Navier Stokes flows, there is now a growing awareness of the need to extend the research focus to systems with more general patterns of energy injection and dissipation. These include various types of complex fluids and plasmas, as well as active systems consisting of self-propelled particles, like dense bacterial suspensions. Recently, a continuum model has been proposed for such "living fluids" that is based on the NavierStokes equations, but extends them to include some of the most general terms admitted by the symmetry of the problem [Wensink HH, et al. (2012) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 109:1430814313]. This introduces a cubic nonlinearity, related to the TonerTu theory of flocking, which can interact with the quadratic NavierStokes nonlinearity. We show that as a result of the subtle interaction between these two terms, the energy spectra at large spatial scales exhibit power laws that are not universal, but depend on both finite-size effects and physical parameters. Our combined numerical and analytical analysis reveals the origin of this effect and even provides a way to understand it quantitatively. Turbulence in active fluids, characterized by this kind of nonlinear self-organization, defines a new class of turbulent flows.},

abstract = {Self-sustained dynamical phases of living matter can exhibit remarkable similarities over a wide range of scales, from mesoscopic vortex structures in microbial suspensions and motility assays of biopolymers to turbulent large-scale instabilities in flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we argue that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations. Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that microscopically different biological systems can share universal long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active fluids: a Swift-Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model that extends the classical Toner-Tu theory and appears to be a promising candidate for the quantitative description of dense bacterial suspensions. We discuss how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces, and conclude by outlining future applications. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {Turbulence is ubiquitous, from oceanic currents to small-scale biological and quantum systems. Self-sustained turbulent motion in microbial suspensions presents an intriguing example of collective dynamical behavior among the simplest forms of life and is important for fluid mixing and molecular transport on the micro-scale. The mathematical characterization of turbulence phenomena in active nonequilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for conventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent phases in living matter are universal or system-specific or which generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equations are able to describe them adequately. Here, we combine experiments, particle simulations, and continuum theory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale turbulence in active systems. To study how dimensionality and boundary conditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and structure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in quasi -2D and 3D geometries. Our experimental results for the bacterial flow statistics agree well with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting that at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated by short-range interactions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies, we propose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow. A detailed numerical analysis of the 2D case shows that this theory can reproduce many of the experimentally observed features of self-sustained active turbulence. low Reynolds number swimming | velocity increment distributions | scaling S imple forms of life, like amoebae or bacteria, self-organize into remarkable macroscopic patterns (1, 2), ranging from extended networks (3, 4) to complex vortices (5-10) and swarms (11). These structures often bear a striking resemblance to assemblies of higher organisms [e.g., flocks of birds (12) or schools of fish (13, 14)] and present important biological model systems to study nonequilibrium phases and their transitions (15-17). A particularly interesting manifestation of collective behavior in microbial suspensions is the emergence of meso-scale turbulent motion (7, 8, 18, 19). Driven by the microorganisms' self-propulsion and their mutual interactions, such self-sustained "active turbulence" can have profound effects on nutrient mixing and molecular transport in microbiological systems (2, 20-22). However, in spite of recent progress (19, 23-25), the phenomenology of turbulent bacterial dynamics is scarcely understood and a commonly accepted theoretical description is lacking (2, 16, 26). The latter fact may not be surprising given that a comprehensive mathematical characterization of turbulence in conventional fluids has remained elusive after more than a century of intense research (27). In view of the various physical and chemical pathways through which bacteria may communicate (1, 11, 28), a basic yet unsolved problem is to identify those interactions that are responsible for the emergence of collective behavior in dense suspensions (2, 29, 30). Answering this question is essential for understanding whether physical mechanisms such as flagellar bundling or hydro-dynamic long-range interactions are relevant to collective bacterial motion; it is also crucial for constraining the vast number of theoretical models that have been proposed during the past two decades (2, 16, 19, 31, 32) but have yet to be tested against experiments. An equally important, unresolved issue pertains to the "universality" of turbulent phenomena in active systems and their relation to turbulence in passive fluids (27). In ordinary liquids and gases, such as water or air, turbulent vortices form due to external forcing if the Reynolds number (Re), the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, is very large (Re ≫ 1). By contrast, bacteria provide an internal microscopic forcing and operate at Re ∼ 10 −5 (33). It is therefore unclear how, or to what extent, the characteristics of self-sustained turbulent states in microbial sus-pensions differ from those of classical turbulence in passive fluids. Here, we combine numerical simulations, high-speed microscopic imaging and continuum theory to identify generic statistical properties of active turbulent motion in dense bacterial systems, using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism. Unlike previous investigations of collective bacterial swimming in 2D free-standing films (8) and 3D bulk suspensions with liquid-gas interfaces (7, 24, 25), we conducted experiments in closed quasi-2D and 3D microfluidic chambers to minimize external influences and to compare the effects of boundary conditions and dimensionality. Our analysis focuses on traditional turbulence measures, such as energy spectra and velocity structure functions (27, 34, 35). These quantities have been widely studied for turbulent high-Re Navier-Stokes flow (27, 36-41), but their characteristics are largely unknown for active fluids. We compare our experimental results with large-scale simulations of a 2D minimal model for self-propelled rods. In the past, similar models (42) have proven useful for identifying generic aspects of flocking and swarming in active systems (43, 44). We find that, although the SPR model neglects details of bacterial cell-cell interactions, it is able to reproduce many features of our experimental data, suggesting that collective bacterial dynamics in dense suspensions is dominated by short-range interactions (30). We complement our experiments and particle-based simulation studies by identifying a minimal continuum model for incompressible active flow that combines elements from the Toner-Tu (15-17) and Swift-Hohen-berg (45) theories. Results Motivation for the SPR Model. Self-motile bacteria may form meso-scale vortex patterns if their concentration is sufficiently large (7, 8, 18, 19). At very high volume fractions (ϕ ≳ 40{\%}), steric repulsion and other short-range interactions (e.g., lubrication},
